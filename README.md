In this notebook, I explore a Spotify dataset from 1921-2020 with 160k+ Tracks found on Kaggle to find the most popular/influential collaboration artists. This will be done by transforming the data into a network of artists connected by collaborations weighted by popularity.

"Collaboration is an artist's best friend in today's music economy. From widening an artist's audience to prolonging success, a rising tide really does lift all boats." This is known as the â€œcollaboration phenomenon." Many artists also gain or give recognition through collaborations and features, and thus seeing the top artists grouped by popularity is one indication of their influence in the collaboration space.

Results: The top 10 most popular collab artists are: 
1. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
2. Lil Wayne
3. Kanye West
4. Snoop Dogg
5. Johann Sebastian Bach
6. Drake
7. JAY-Z
8. Nicki Minaj
9. 2Pac
10. Eminem

Most of the artists in the top 10 are known to make HipHop/Rapping style music, which is to be expected as this is the most popular genre in the recent years and is an industry that also thrives on collaborations.

Surprisingly however, there are a few classical musicians, with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart being the most popular collab artist beating out artists such as Lil Wayne aand Kanye West that are known for their hit songs with collaborations and using collabs to give recognition to smaller artists.
